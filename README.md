# Summary
Most CitiBikeShare users ride during in the mornings and evenings Mon-Fri. There is consistent usage on the weekends. Most citibikeshare users are male. Most citibikeshare users ride for less than 40 minutes. Most citibikeshare users ride in Manhattan, in all areas. There are some users in Brooklyn. In two additional visuals that I provide below, we can see clearly that most citibikeshare users are born between 1980 and 1995. They are young but not that young, probably college educated, probably professionals who are using the bikes to commute to work, and they are probably subscribers. Further investigation could uncover for sure what the composition of this group is.
